# OnTheBeach frontend developer code test

Produce a HTML, CSS and JavaScript representation of the given `design.png` with the following features:

- Sort the results by price (this should be the default)
- Sort the results by star rating and highlighted when active
- Sort the results alphabetically by hotel name and highlighted when active
- Ability to toggle expanded hotel description

We are looking for a client side solution, there should be no server logic involved.

Feel free to use a JavaScript library or framework but nothing off the shelf should be used to provide this functionality (no jQuery plugins or Bootstrap etc). Imagine this will be a component added to a large website.

You may use things like CSS Preprocessors and CoffeeScript, but if you do please include the source files.

Things we like:

- Semantic HTML
- Modular CSS
- Clean error free JavaScript
